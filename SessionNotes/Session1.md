	This work is Marx's attempt at exploring themes in Hegel's philosophy where,  `"the interconnection between political economy and the state, law, ethics, civil life, etc., is touched on in the present work only to the extent to which political economy itself ex professo touches on these subjects." (Pg.14).` The sections following this that are crossed out for deletion (the lines in the square brackets) is where he seems to be drawing out a separation between himself and 'Critical Theologians', which from my perspective seems to be Right Hegelians. For this work, Marx makes use of French, English, and German socialist writers. Of the German writers, Marx praises Freurbach, Hess and Engles, with special attention to  Freurbach, who he believes to be the starting point of a positive, naturalistic and humanistic criticism (Pg. 15).
	Hegel stands as a real revolution in theory and Marx believes Hegel has yet to be fully explored, and its contemporaries (Critical Theologians) have foundational errors. These Critical Theologians  take credit for these theoretical developments, while only understanding them in the abstract. In the much more nuanced sense too, while Freurbach tends to stick to the spiritual categories Hegel uses such as "Self-consciousness" and "Mind", the Critical Theologian does not understand these higher, absolute categories. To be more direct, `"On close inspection theological criticism - genuinely progressive though it was at the inception of the movement - is seen in the final analysis to be nothing but the culmination and consequence of the old philosophical, and especially the Hegelian, transcendentalism, twisted into a theological caricature. (Pg. 17)`
	In summary,  this work is meant to be an exploration of Political Economy where Hegel's thought can develop. The point is to see it through what Marx thinks this development in Philosophy can assist in Political Economy.
