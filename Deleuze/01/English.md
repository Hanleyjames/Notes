To reread Deleuze's work after his death, through an almost natural retrospective illusion, his texts turn out to be punctuated with phrophetic anticipations of this tragic destiny. Dark lines steadily weaving through its pages and their problems, the occurrences of death are constantly reactivating. Death, that word, the most concrete, always abstractly arranged in the economy of a chain or an argument, always neutralized by the use that life makes of it. These occurrences remind us by this impossible choice and yet obviously necessary, that the great choice of the thought of Deleuze (and therefore for all), is a deliberate choice (therefore enlightened) to fight against chaos: thought in this respect always constrained and forced "misosophy" comes more than "philosophy" violent creation of life and not diaphanous rise to any heaven of ideas. In this regard, should we recall, against the astonishment or questioning of some, that the choice of death when it is taken, far from being the triumph of death over life, constitutes the pursuit of the same life of thought by other means ... Not Oedipus in Colone drawing the negative balance of his life, but life always affirmative not ceasing to enlighten us as usual on the resources of resistance in the face of the unacceptable.
